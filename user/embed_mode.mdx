[**Recomi**](https://powerdrill.ai/recomi) is an AI Agent service that allows you to embed AI-driven interactions into your website or application seamlessly. It supports two embedding modes:

- **Chat Bubble**: A script-based chat widget that expands when clicked, ideal for websites built with tools like Bubble, Framer, Webflow, and Wix.

- **Iframe**: A fully embedded chat window that provides flexibility in size and placement, suitable for web applications requiring more customization.

## Embedding via Chat Bubble

The chat bubble mode enables a floating icon on your website. When users click on the icon, the chat window expands, providing a non-intrusive interaction experience.

This approach is ideal for website builders such as **Bubble**, **Framer**, **Webflow**, **Wix**, **Hostinger**, etc., where you may not have direct control over the backend but can insert custom scripts.

## Embedding via Iframe

The iframe mode allows you to embed the chat window directly into your web application. This provides greater flexibility, as you can control the iframe’s placement, size, and behavior within your UI.

This method is particularly useful for web applications that require a dedicated chat section within the UI.

Please choosing the right mode according to your needs.
- Use Chat Bubble if you want a minimal and non-intrusive chat experience that appears only when clicked.
- Use Iframe if you need a fully embedded chat interface with fixed placement and customizable dimensions.

By selecting the appropriate mode, you can ensure that the Recomi AI Agent seamlessly integrates with your digital platform, enhancing user engagement with AI-powered conversations.
