## How to Add the AI Agent to Your Website
Recomi offers three primary integration methods to seamlessly embed the chatbot into your website:

### 1. Iframe
With the iframe method, you can embed the chatbot into multiple pages by simply inserting the provided iframe code. Once integrated, the chatbot remains always visible on those specific pages, providing users with an uninterrupted experience.

The iframe is static, meaning the chatbot stays open and readily available for visitors. This ensures effortless engagement without the need for additional pop-ups or triggers, enhancing usability and accessibility.

### 2. Chat Bubble
The chat bubble option allows you to embed a floating chat icon in the bottom corner of your selected pages. When clicked, it opens a pop-up chat window, enabling users to interact with the AI Agent without leaving the page.

Users can minimize the chat window at any time, returning it to a compact bubble. This ensures the chatbot remains non-intrusive while always being easily accessible for seamless communication.
