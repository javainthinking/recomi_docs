How to integrate a Recomi AI agent into your Slack workspace:

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Recomi AI Agent

To integrate a Recomi AI agent into your [**Slack**](https://slack.com/) workspace, start by logging into your Recomi account. If you don't have an account yet, you can create one for free. After logging in, configure your agent within the Recomi platform by uploading relevant data sources, such as text file, documents, which will help the agent build its knowledge base.

## Step 2: Navigate to the Slack Integration

1. Once you have a Recomi account and an AI agent set up, head over to your dashboard. On your dashboard, you’ll find a list of all the agents you have created. Locate and click on the agent you wish to integrate with Slack.

2. After clicking on an agent, the agent detailed page should come up, click on **Integration** at the top of the page and then the **Integrations** tab on the left side of the page. This will take you to a page with a list of integration options.

3. Click on **Connect** under the Slack card

1. Open any channel on your Slack workspace, and type @Recomi followed by any question related to the purpose of your chatbot. This should initiate a prompt by Slack asking you to invite the chatbot to the channel or take no action.

2. Click on **Add Them**. The chatbot will then be available in the channel to answer any questions you might have.
