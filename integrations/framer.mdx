## Step 1: Setting Up Your Recomi AI Agent

To embed a Recomi AI agent into your [**Framer**](https://framer.com/) website, start by logging into your Recomi account. If you don't have an account yet, you can create one for free. After logging in, configure your agent within the Recomi platform by uploading relevant data sources, such as text file, documents, which will help the agent build its knowledge base.

Follow these steps to ensure a smooth integration of your Recomi AI agent into your Framer website.

## Step 2: Generate and Copy Your Recomi AI Agent Embed Code

1. Every agent created in Recomi comes with a unique embed code that allows it to be integrated into your website or application. Once your agent is set up, navigate to the [**Dashboard**](https://recomi.powerdrill.ai/agents) and select the specific agent you want to integrate with Bubble.

3. On this page, you will find the option of **Embed a chat bubble** to Copy Script. Click this button to copy the agent's embed SDK Code.

4. Click Settings to open the **Settings** for that page.

5. On the **Settings** page, scroll down to find the section labeled **Custom Code**.

6. Right under the **Custom Code** section, paste your Recomi AI agent embed code in the first box labeled "End of &lt;body&gt; tag" and click **Save** on the top right corner of the panel. Then you can publish the page to see the AI agent in action. (Notes: you must **Publish** the page to see the AI agent in action, **Preview** will not show the AI agent. If you don't see the AI agent icon, please refresh the page. For the topic of Framer Custom Code, please refer to the tutorial video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_oL9cvknUY).)
