You can add a Recomi AI agent to your Google Chrome Extension by following the steps below. If you'd like to customize a chrome extension, you can refer to our open sourced [Recomi chrome extension](https://github.com/powerdrillai/recomi-chrome-extension). Or you can install and use our Recomi Chrome Extension to load any Recomi AI chatbot on your chrome web browser.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Recomi AI Agent

Start by logging into your Recomi account. If you don't have an account yet, you can create one for free. After logging in, configure your agent within the Recomi platform by uploading relevant data sources, such as text file, documents, which will help the agent build its knowledge base.
