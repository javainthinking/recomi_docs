# Integrating Recomi AI Agent with Squarespace

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Recomi AI Agent

To embed a Recomi AI agent into your [**Squarespace**](https://www.squarespace.com/) website, start by logging into your Recomi account. If you don't have an account yet, you can create one for free. After logging in, configure your agent within the Recomi platform by uploading relevant data sources, such as text file, documents, website links, which will help the agent build its knowledge base.

Follow these steps to ensure a smooth integration of your Recomi AI agent into your Squarespace website.

## Step 2: Generate and Copy Your Recomi AI Agent Embed Code

1. Every agent created in Recomi comes with a unique embed code that allows it to be integrated into your website or application. Once your agent is set up, navigate to the [**Dashboard**](https://recomi.powerdrill.ai/agents) and select the specific agent you want to integrate with Bubble.
